      ucapan = `Dear Love,
Four months have passed, a time that feels like a piece of polaroid neatly stored in our memories album. Every day together feels like an analog film sheet wrapped in nostalgic colors - soft, meaningful, and full of nuances.
You are the most beautiful landscape in my life's journey. Like a mesmerizing golden hour, you come and change everything to be more beautiful. Each of our moments is like an unforgettable cinema frame - sometimes blurry, sometimes crystal clear, but always mesmerizing.
These 4 months are not just numbers. It's a story we're slowly weaving, with threads of trust, laughter, and dreams. You are an irreplaceable aesthetic, like an indie song that makes me always want to repeat the play.
Thank you for being a separate color in the canvas of my life. Every touch, every word, every look - you make me feel like the main character in the most beautiful story.

With all the feelings,
Someone who always falls in love with you, every day.`;
